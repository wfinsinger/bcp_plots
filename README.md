# bcp_plot_function.R

The bcp_plot_function.R plots the results of two different bayesian change-point analyses in one single plot.
Here I provide two example files illustrating the function using artificial datasets.

## Example 1
Change-point analysis of a sequence **with a change in mean and with constant sediment-accumulation rates**.

## Example 2
Change-point analysis of a sequence **without a change in mean, but with a substantial change in sediment-accumulation rates** that causes the emergence of a change point.
